        <h2> Computer Science </h2>
        <p> I have had interest in computer science from class 6th, when I wrote my first program in Visual Basic.
        Afterwards we were introduced to many different topics in computer like MS Office, MS Access but only in 11th I got
        to work in Java and Mysql.Then in engineering I used to code in C++, C, Python for coding competitions.</p>
